# Encryptionsuite (File Encryption and Decryption)
This is a CLI tool for encrypting and decrypting files and folders.
Be carefull on how you use, irresponsible use can lead user to turning their data into chunks
if encryption keys are miss-handled.
For every encrypte file an Encryption key used is save in filename.xml file
where filename is name of the input file to be encrypted.
## Name variations
```shell
   Encryptionsuite -h
   encryptionsuite -h
   ENCRYPTIONSUITE -h
```
## Installation

1. Install via pip:

   ```shell
   pip install Encryptionsuite
      ```
2. Install from github:

   pip install git+https://github.com/skye-cyber/Encryptionsuite.git
   ```


## Usage

To run the CLI app, use the following command:

`1`.``-m/--mode`` operation to be performed(encryption or Decryption) value ```[encrypt, decrypt]```

`2`.``-i/--input_file``

`3`.``-k/--key`` only when decrypting

## Examples

1. Example command 1:

   Encryptionsuite -m encrypt -i example.txt or ```FED --mode encrypt -input_file example.txt```
   ```
in this case the output file will be 'example.txt.encrypted'

2. Example command 2:
   ```shell
   Encryptionsuite -m decrypt -i example.txt.encrypted -k xxxx where xxxx is the encryption key used
   ```

    ```shell
    Encryptionsuite -m decrypt -i example.txt.encrypted -k file where file is the file containing the key
