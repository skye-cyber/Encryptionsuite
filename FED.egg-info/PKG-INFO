# FED (File Encryption and Decryption)
This is a CLI tool for encrypting and decrypting files and folders.
Be carefull on how you use, irresponsible use can lead user to turning their data into chunks
if encryption keys are miss-handled.
For every encrypte file an Encryption key used is save in filename.xml file
where filename is name of the input file to be encrypted.
